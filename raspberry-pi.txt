sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
sudo pip3 install rpi.gpio --upgrade


cd /dev
chmod og+rwx gpio*

This is a permissions issue, your user does not have read-write access to /dev/gpiomem. Here's one way to give access:

change /dev/gpiomem group ownership to your user's group:
sudo chown root:$USER /dev/gpiomem
allow group read-write access to /dev/gpiomem:
sudo chmod g+rw /dev/gpiomem
Note that it would be better to add your user to the group that owns /dev/gpiomem instead of changing group ownership as @lurch notes below. However, by default /dev/gpiomem group ownership is root in Ubuntu and adding your user to the root group would expand your user privileges which you probably don't want. Hence the group ownership change.
