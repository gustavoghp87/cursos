// services.AddScoped(typeof(IRepository<>), typeof(BaseRepository<>));

// Transient objects are always different; a new instance is provided to every controller
//    and every service.
// Scoped objects are the same within a request, but different across different requests.
// Singleton objects are the same for every object and every request.

// Transient para Servicios y UnitOfWork, Scoped para Repository
