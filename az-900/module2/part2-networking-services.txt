Azure virtual networking:
 Azure virtual networks enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. You can think of an Azure network as a set of resources that links other Azure resources.
 Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:
 -Isolation and segmentation
  Virtual Network allows you to create multiple isolated virtual networks. When you set up a virtual network, you define a private IP address space by using either public or private IP address ranges. You can divide that IP address space into subnets and allocate part of the defined address space to each named subnet.
  For name resolution, you can use the name resolution service that's built in to Azure. You also can configure the virtual network to use either an internal or an external DNS server.

 -Internet communications
  A VM in Azure can connect to the internet by default. You can enable incoming connections from the internet by defining a public IP address or a public load balancer. For VM management, you can connect via the Azure CLI, Remote Desktop Protocol, or Secure Shell.

 -Communicate between Azure resources
  You'll want to enable Azure resources to communicate securely with each other. You can do that in one of two ways:
  -Virtual networks Virtual networks can connect not only VMs but other Azure resources, such as the App Service Environment for Power Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure virtual machine scale sets.
  -Service endpoints You can use service endpoints to connect to other Azure resource types, such as Azure SQL databases and storage accounts. This approach enables you to link multiple Azure resources to virtual networks to improve security and provide optimal routing between resources.

 -Communicate with on-premises resources
  Azure virtual networks enable you to link resources together in your on-premises environment and within your Azure subscription. In effect, you can create a network that spans both your local and cloud environments. There are three mechanisms for you to achieve this connectivity:
   -Point-to-site virtual private networks The typical approach to a virtual private network (VPN) connection is from a computer outside your organization, back into your corporate network. In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect that computer to the Azure virtual network.
   -Site-to-site virtual private networks A site-to-site VPN links your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network. In effect, the devices in Azure can appear as being on the local network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.
   -Azure ExpressRoute For environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security, Azure ExpressRoute is the best approach. ExpressRoute provides dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet. 

 -Route network traffic
  By default, Azure routes traffic between subnets on any connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet. You also can control routing and override those settings, as follows:
  -Route tables A route table allows you to define rules about how traffic should be directed. You can create custom route tables that control how packets are routed between subnets.
  -Border Gateway Protocol Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) works with Azure VPN gateways or ExpressRoute to propagate on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks.

 -Filter network traffic
  Azure virtual networks enable you to filter traffic between subnets by using the following approaches:
  -Network security groups A network security group is an Azure resource that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. You can define these rules to allow or block traffic, based on factors such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.
  -Network virtual appliances A network virtual appliance is a specialized VM that can be compared to a hardened network appliance. A network virtual appliance carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing wide area network (WAN) optimization.

 -Connect virtual networks
  You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering. Peering enables resources in each virtual network to communicate with each other. These virtual networks can be in separate regions, which allows you to create a global interconnected network through Azure.
  UDR is user-defined Routing. UDR is a significant update to Azureâ€™s Virtual Networks as this allows network admins to control the routing tables between subnets within a VNet, as well as between VNets, thereby allowing for greater control over network traffic flow.




VPN gateways
A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed in Azure Virtual Network instances and enable the following connectivity:
 -Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.
 -Connect individual devices to virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.
 -Connect virtual networks to other virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.

Policy-based VPNs
 Policy-based VPN gateways specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel. This type of device evaluates every data packet against those sets of IP addresses to choose the tunnel where that packet is going to be sent through.
 Key features of policy-based VPN gateways in Azure include:
  -Support for IKEv1 only.
  -Use of static routing, where combinations of address prefixes from both networks control how traffic is encrypted and decrypted through the VPN tunnel. The source and destination of the tunneled networks are declared in the policy and don't need to be declared in routing tables.
  -Policy-based VPNs must be used in specific scenarios that require them, such as for compatibility with legacy on-premises VPN devices.

Route-based VPNs
 If defining which IP addresses are behind each tunnel is too cumbersome, route-based gateways can be used. With route-based gateways, IPSec tunnels are modeled as a network interface or virtual tunnel interface. IP routing (either static routes or dynamic routing protocols) decides which one of these tunnel interfaces to use when sending each packet. Route-based VPNs are the preferred connection method for on-premises devices. They're more resilient to topology changes such as the creation of new subnets.
 Use a route-based VPN gateway if you need any of the following types of connectivity:
  -Connections between virtual networks
  -Point-to-site connections
  -Multisite connections
  -Coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway
 Key features of route-based VPN gateways in Azure include:
  -Supports IKEv2
  -Uses any-to-any (wildcard) traffic selectors
  -Can use dynamic routing protocols, where routing/forwarding tables direct traffic to different IPSec tunnels In this case, the source and destination networks aren't statically defined as they are in policy-based VPNs or even in route-based VPNs with static routing. Instead, data packets are encrypted based on network routing tables that are created dynamically using routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).


You'll need these Azure resources before you can deploy an operational VPN gateway:
 -Virtual network
 -GatewaySubnet
 -Public IP address
 -Local network gateway
 -Virtual network gateway
 -Connection





Azure ExpressRoute fundamentals
ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365.
Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet. This allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.
