Azure Blob Access tiers

A storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data, that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in this account is secure, highly
 available, durable, and massively scalable.


Disk storage fundamentals
 Disk Storage provides disks for Azure virtual machines. Applications and other services can access and use these disks as needed, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios.
 Disk Storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.


Azure Blob storage fundamentals
 Azure Blob Storage is an object storage solution for the cloud. It can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob Storage is unstructured, meaning that
  there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold.
 One advantage of blob storage over disk storage is that it does not require developers to think about or manage disks; data is uploaded as blobs, and Azure takes care of the physical
  storage needs.
 Blob Storage is ideal for:
  -Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
  -Storing files for distributed access.
  -Streaming video and audio.
  -Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
  -Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.
  -Storing up to 8 TB of data for virtual machines.


Blob access tiers:
 Azure Storage offers different access tiers for your blob storage, helping you store object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:
 -Hot access tier: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).
 -Cool access tier: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
 -Archive access tier: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).
