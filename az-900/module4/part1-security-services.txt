Azure Security Center
 It is a monitoring service that provides visibility of your security posture across all of your services, both on Azure and on-premises. The term security posture refers to
 cybersecurity policies and controls, as well as how well you can predict, prevent, and respond to security threats.
 Security Center can:
  -Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads.
  -Automatically apply required security settings to new resources as they come online.
  -Provide security recommendations that are based on your current configurations, resources, and networks.
  -Continuously monitor your resources and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before those vulnerabilities can be exploited.
  -Use machine learning to detect and block malware from being installed on your virtual machines (VMs) and other resources. You can also use adaptive application controls to define
   rules that list allowed applications to ensure that only applications you allow can run.
  -Detect and analyze potential inbound attacks and investigate threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
  -Provide just-in-time access control for network ports. Doing so reduces your attack surface by ensuring that the network only allows traffic that you require at the time that you
   need it to.
 Gets a centralized view of all of its security alerts. From there, the company can dismiss false alerts, investigate them further, remediate alerts manually, or use an automated
  response with a workflow automation. Workflow automation uses Azure Logic Apps and Security Center connectors. The logic app can be triggered by a threat detection alert or by a
  Security Center recommendation, filtered by name or by severity. You can then configure the logic app to run an action, such as sending an email, or posting a message to a Microsoft
  Teams channel.
 Just-in-time VM access: blocks traffic by default to specific network ports of VMs.
 Adaptive application controls: provides alerts that inform the company about unauthorized applications that are running on its VMs.
 Adaptive network hardening: monitors the internet traffic patterns of the VMs, and compares those patterns with the company's current network security group (NSG) settings.
 File integrity monitoring: monitors changes to important files.


Secure score
 It is a measurement of an organization's security posture. Secure score is based on security controls, or groups of related security recommendations.
 Your score is based on the percentage of security controls that you satisfy.
 Secure score helps you:
  -Report on the current state of your organization's security posture.
  -Improve your security posture by providing discoverability, visibility, guidance, and control.
  -Compare with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs).


Azure Sentinel
 It is a security information and event management (SIEM) system. It uses intelligent security analytics and threat analysis.
 A SIEM system aggregates security data from many different sources (as long as those sources support an open-standard logging format). These connections are handled by built-in
  connectors or industry-standard log formats and APIs.
 Azure Sentinel enables you to:
  -Collect cloud data at scale: Collect data across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and from multiple clouds.
  -Detect previously undetected threats: Minimize false positives by using Microsoft's comprehensive analytics and threat intelligence.
  -Investigate threats with artificial intelligence: Examine suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cybersecurity experience from Microsoft.
  -Respond to incidents rapidly: Use built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks.
 You can use both built-in analytics and custom rules to detect threats:
  -Built in analytics: use templates designed by Microsoft's team of security experts and analysts based on known threats, common attack vectors, and escalation chains for suspicious
   activity. These templates can be customized and search across the environment for any activity that looks suspicious. Some templates use machine learning behavioral analytics that
   are based on Microsoft proprietary algorithms.
  -Custom analytics are rules that you create to search for specific criteria within your environment. You can preview the number of results that the query would generate (based on past
   log events) and set a schedule for the query to run. You can also set an alert threshold.
 With the investigation graph, the company can review information from entities directly connected to the alert, and see common exploration queries to help guide the investigation.
 Azure Monitor Workbooks: automates responses to threats.


Azure Key Vault
 It is a centralized cloud service for storing an application's secrets in a single, central location. It provides secure access to sensitive information by providing access control and
  logging capabilities.
 -Centralized application secrets
 -Securely stored secrets and keys
 -Access monitoring and access control
 -Simplified administration of application secrets
 -Integration with other Azure services


Azure Dedicated Host
 It provides dedicated physical servers to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux.
