TCO Calculator
 The TCO Calculator helps you estimate the cost savings of operating your solution on Azure over time, instead of in your on-premises datacenter.
 With the TCO Calculator, you enter the details of your on-premises workloads. Then you review the suggested industry average cost (which you can adjust) for related operational costs.
  These costs include electricity, network maintenance, and IT labor. You're then presented with a side-by-side report. Using the report, you can compare those costs with the same
  workloads running on Azure.
 For each category (compute, datacenter, networking, storage, and IT labor), you can also view a side-by-side comparison of the cost breakdown of operating those workloads on-premises
  versus operating them on Azure.
