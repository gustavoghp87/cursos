TCO Calculator
 The TCO Calculator helps you estimate the cost savings of operating your solution on Azure over time, instead of in your on-premises datacenter.
 With the TCO Calculator, you enter the details of your on-premises workloads. Then you review the suggested industry average cost (which you can adjust) for related operational costs.
  These costs include electricity, network maintenance, and IT labor. You're then presented with a side-by-side report. Using the report, you can compare those costs with the same
  workloads running on Azure.
 For each category (compute, datacenter, networking, storage, and IT labor), you can also view a side-by-side comparison of the cost breakdown of operating those workloads on-premises
  versus operating them on Azure.

Azure Pricing Calculator
 It allows you to estimate the monthly cost of a cloud solution.


Free trial: A free trial subscription provides you with 12 months of popular free services, a credit to explore any Azure service for 30 days, and more than 25 services that are always
 free. Your Azure services are disabled when the trial ends or when your credit expires for paid products, unless you upgrade to a paid subscription.
Pay-as-you-go: A pay-as-you-go subscription enables you to pay for what you use by attaching a credit or debit card to your account. Organizations can apply for volume discounts and
 prepaid invoicing.
Member offers: Your existing membership to certain Microsoft products and services might provide you with credits for your Azure account and reduced rates on Azure services. For
 example, member offers are available to Visual Studio subscribers, Microsoft Partner Network members, Microsoft for Startups members, and Microsoft Imagine members.


There are three main ways to purchase services on Azure. They are:
 -Through an Enterprise Agreement: Larger customers, known as enterprise customers, can sign an Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft. This agreement commits them to spending a
  predetermined amount on Azure services over a period of three years. The service fee is typically paid annually. As an Enterprise Agreement customer, you'll receive the best
  customized pricing based on the kinds and amounts of services you plan on using.
 -Directly from the web: Here, you purchase Azure services directly from the Azure portal website and pay standard prices. You're billed monthly, as a credit card payment or through an
  invoice. This purchasing method is known as Web Direct.
 -Through a Cloud Solution Provider: A Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) is a Microsoft Partner who helps you build solutions on top of Azure. Your CSP bills you for your Azure usage at a
  price they determine. They also answer your support questions and escalate them to Microsoft, as needed.


What factors affect cost? Resource type, Usage meters, and Resource usage.

Azure Advisor identifies unused or underutilized resources and recommends unused resources that you can remove.

Azure Reservations offers discounted prices on certain Azure services. Azure Reservations can save you up to 72 percent as compared to pay-as-you-go prices. To receive a discount, you
 reserve services and resources by paying in advance.
